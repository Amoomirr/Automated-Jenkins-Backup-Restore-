## Project Description

The goal of this project was to:

* Automate periodic backups of the Jenkins home directory.
* Upload compressed backups to Amazon S3 securely.
* Enable one-command restore functionality from S3 to Jenkins.
* Follow best practices for security, reliability, and maintainability.

### Key services and technologies used:

* Jenkins
* Amazon S3
* AWS IAM
* Linux Server (Ubuntu)
* Bash Scripting
* Cron Jobs

## Architecture Overview

* Jenkins Server hosted on EC2 or on-prem Linux machine
* IAM user created with limited S3 permissions
* Scheduled backup using `cron`
* `.tar.gz` compression of Jenkins home directory
* Upload to specific S3 bucket path
* Restore script to pull and extract backup
